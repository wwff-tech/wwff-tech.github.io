Mike has been in the tech industry for well over 20 years, which means he is experienced but also kinda old-school.

He often programs as part of his job as a DevOps Team Lead at a large multinational media company and has been known to give talks at both events, user groups, and internally on various subjects.

In his personal time you may find him in the outdoors, building software or electronic gadgets, or occassionally when he gets the chance, reading science fiction; with a bias to hard sci-fi.
